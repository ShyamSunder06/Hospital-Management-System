## ðŸ›  Problems and Solutions  

### 1. *No Standardized Way to Store Patient Medical History*  
- *Problem*: Patient records are fragmented, making it difficult to access medical history seamlessly.  
- *Solution*:  
  - *Integration of ABHA ID*:  
    - ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) ID is a unique identifier for medical records.  
    - Patient data, prescriptions, and test results are linked to their ABHA ID, enabling digitized and centralized medical history storage.  

---

### 2. *Overcrowding in OPDs*  
- *Problem*: Long waiting times and disorganized queues lead to inefficiency and delayed patient care.  
- *Solution*:  
  - *Queue Management System*:  
    - Patients can check-in via our portal for priority appointments or walk-in and register at the reception.  
    - Patients are classified into high or low priority to ensure urgent cases are attended to first.  
    - Streamlined queueing reduces waiting times and prevents overcrowding.

### 3. *Lack of Coordination Within and Between Hospitals*  
- *Problem*: Ineffective communication between hospital departments and no system for inter-hospital data sharing.  
- *Solution*:  
  - *Intra-Hospital Coordination*:  
    - Doctors can input prescriptions into the system, linked to the patient's ABHA ID.  
    - Patients can access their medications at the pharmacy using their ABHA ID.  
    - Lab tests can be ordered digitally, and results are accessible to doctors via the ABHA ID.  
  - *Inter-Hospital Coordination*:  
    - Enables seamless transfer of patient records between hospitals within a city for better continuity of care.

### 4. *Inefficient Resource Allocation*  
- *Problem*: Overworked staff and under-optimized scheduling lead to inefficiency and poor patient experience.  
- *Solution*:  
  - *Predictive Resource Allocation*:  
    - Use AI-based models to predict patient flow in OPDs based on factors like weather and day of the week.  
    - Implement a formula: Patients per Doctor per Hour (PPHD) to guide optimal doctor allocation.  
    - Reduces staff burnout and ensures appropriate resource availability.  

---

### 5. *Inefficient Data Retrieval in Existing Systems (HMIS)*  
- *Problem*: The HMIS developed by TCS failed due to centralized databases leading to slow data retrieval and time-consuming processes.  
- *Solution*:  
  - *Decentralized Database Architecture*:  
    - Each hospital has its own dedicated database, enhancing data retrieval speed and system scalability.  
    - Improves computational efficiency compared to a centralized database system.
